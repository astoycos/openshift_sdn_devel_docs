============================
So You Want to Contribute...
============================

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with replace with the service it implements.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. This would be a good place to put the channel you chat in as a project; when/
   where your meeting is, the tags you prepend to your ML threads, etc.

Contacting the Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. This section should list the core team, their irc nicks, emails, timezones
   etc. If all this info is maintained elsewhere (i.e. a wiki), you can link to
   that instead of enumerating everyone here.

New Feature Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. This section is for talking about the process to get a new feature in. Some
   projects use blueprints, some want specs, some want both! Some projects
   stick to a strict schedule when selecting what new features will be reviewed
   for a release.

Task Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. This section is about where you track tasks- launchpad? storyboard? is there
   more than one launchpad project? what's the name of the project group in
   storyboard?

We track our tasks in Jira


Reporting a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Pretty self explanatory section, link directly to where people should report
   bugs for your project.

We track our bugs in Bugzilla

Getting Your Patch Merged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. This section should have info about what it takes to get something merged. Do
   you require one or two +2's before +W? Do some of your repos require unit
   test changes with all patches? etc.
